# Todo List
All notable actionable items to be done on this project will be listed here.

## Possible Ideas
- Fae elective modifiers based on fae queen/blood
- Dark elves based on those who fall to a "dark" side (maybe those who lose an election, maybe if realm is unstable due to queen's death/return)
- More events!!! (maybe life/immersion events)
- Balance via pushback by human coalitions against the encroaching fae
- Longer chain for return event
- Chain for becoming fae queen when human player
- Custom head of faith title
